# Requirements
*I used python 3.10.0 to code this assignment.* This version of Python may
be required, because I used Python type hints.

# Execution
If you use pipenv, then all you need to do is run

```
pipenv run start
```

Otherwise, you can just use:

```
python src/main.py
```

from the root directory

# Names of all files
main.py - main file to be executed
algos/__init__.py - inits the algos module, exports required funcs
algo_1.py - file containing the function for algo 1
algo_2.py - file containing the function for algo 2
algo_3.py - file containing the function for algo 3
algo_4.py - file containing the function for algo 4
generators/__init__.py - file containing all the functions I used to generate
various pieces of this assignment, such as the final matrix and the 19 lists

# Certification statement
I certify that I wrote the code I am submitting. I did not copy whole or parts
of it from another student or have another person write the code for me.
Any code I am reusing in my program is clearly marked as such with its source
clearly identified in comments.

There is no code from another source, so there are no such comments
